Multicore programming is not as easy as it sounds. Since I began to learn multi-core programming
(to be specific, multi-threaded programming), the synchronisation of multiple threads relies on locking and mutex.

The use case of locking mutex is simple:

Let's say there is a list shared by multiple thread, and each thread needs to perform certain action with the list,
it can be adding element, it can be removing element, checking size, whatever.
Well, to synchronise the list modification process, threads are required to lock a mutex.
If locking is successful, the thread proceed to acts towards list;
If locking fails, the thread fall into sleep until mutex become available.

#### Wait.....

<br />

The story isn't over...

Back to the list mentioned, we knows that using mutex to synchronise the list modification works.
But when the parallelism of the list modification scales up, we have a new issue, **contention**.

You see, if there exists 100 of threads trying to do something to the list at the same time,
only one of them get access to it thanks to the mutex.
However, it also lets remaining 99 threads fall to sleep until the mutex lock is released.
You might argue that **_"Well I don't bother with that trade off since I have a machine that support 100 of threads to run in parallel."_**,
**Dude**, you already need 100 of threads to do your job, sooner or later you will bother with this trade off.

**_"Ok then, so how about we use multiple mutex?"_**

Well, that may work. it depends on how you use the list.
If the list shared accross 100 of threads is used as queue, which is,
always adding element from end, and extracting element from front, then we may design an algorithm to lock only 1 mutex when adding/deleting element from the list,
with an exceptional case where list only has 1 element. In that case, both locks are required to be locked.

\*\*\*"Great! So I learnt that data sharing accross multiple threads requires some tune to gain performance. Thanks!"

#### You think that solves all the problem?

#### Of course... _No_

<br />
<br />

In a program that requires resource sharing accross multiple threads, most likely there are more than one
resources being shared as well. Which introduces more locks to the logic flow, in turn, increases the chance
of getting **_Dead lock_**.

A very simple scenario of deadlock may occurs is as follow:

1. Imagine there are 2 threads, A & B, and 2 resources being shared, X & Y, guarded by a mutex respectively.
2. In execution of thread A, resource X needs to be acquired then subsequently resource Y.
3. On the other hand, thread B needs to acquire resource Y first, then resource X.
4. When case _2_ and _3_ happens at the same time...
5. #### Pfffff! We got Dead lock!

<br />
<br />

Let's be frank, this kind of dead lock is quite easy to solve: you reorder the lock acquiring to consistent sequence.
That is, always lock X then lock Y, or, always lock Y then X.
But this may introduces overhead: if the logic in thread B only requires resouce X in the very end,
locking X in the first place reduces parallelism of the program. In this case, 50% of parallelism gone!

Now, can we do **_better_**?

"Fxxk it, let's throw all the locks away then."

##### That's right, let's get rid of all locks!!!

"Wait, what? How do we avoid resouce corruption and race condition and other shit?"

Well, we can design the algorithm in a way that the logic of algorithm itself guarantees execution order is correct
without the involve any mutex locking with the help of one tool -- **Atomic**

<br />

### What is Atomicity?

<br />

An atomic operation is an indivisible and irreducible action.
Let's look at an example:

```cpp {3, 11, 20} showLineNumbers
// Non-atomic Assignment

int global_var = 0;

void foo(std::integral auto v) {
  auto var = 100;
  /*
   * Doing some task...
   *
   */
  global_var += 10;
}

int bar(std::integral auto v) {
  auto var = 50;
  /*
   * Doing some task with var...
   *
   */
  return var - global_var;
}
```

As the example above, `var` was assigned value `10`, simple. On the language level, this assignment seems like a single option.
However, at the lower level, this assignment may involve multiple operation!

Now, imagine 1 thread calls the `foo()` and then starts executing and preempted in the middle of executing logic at line `7`.
And then, here comes another thread calling the `bar()` function. What do you think the actual value it reads from `global_var`?

The answer is -- **Undefined**, this is _race condition_.

To avoid this, we need to make use of `<atomic>` library and modify the code abit as follow:

```cpp {4, 13, 22} showLineNumbers
// Atomic Assignment
#include <atomic>

std::atomic<int> global_var{10};
void foo(std::integral auto v) {
  auto var = 100;

  /*
   * Doing some task with var...
   *
   */

  global_var.fech_add(10, std::memory_order::release);
}

int bar(std::integral auto v) {
  auto var = 50;
  /*
   * Doing some task...
   *
   */
  return var - global_var.load(std::memory_order::consume);
}
```

Duh, with the help of atomic type, the race condition no longer exist as it guarantees every read/write operation to it is always indivisible.
So if a thread executing modified version of `foo()`, `global_var` is guarantees to be modified in single operation,
and so does `global_var` reading in `bar()` not get read in intermidiate state.

So now, since the program does not has any lock (even though under the hood there is still lock somewhere), it's lock free!

##### This is Lock-Free Programming!

We will dive deeper into discussion about the challenges & pitfalls to tackle when practicing lock-free programming.

That's it for today.
