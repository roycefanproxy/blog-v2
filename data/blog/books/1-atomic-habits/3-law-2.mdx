## Chapter 8

- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.

- Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When the dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.

- It is the anticipation of a reward motivates us to take action, not the fullfillment of it.
  The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.

- Temptation bundling is a way to make a habit more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you **want** to do with an action you **need** to do.

## Chapter 9

- The culture we live in determines what behaviours are attractive.

- We tend to adopt habits thate are approved of and praised by our culture because we have strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.

- We tend to imitate the habits of 3 social groups:

  1. The close
  1. The many
  1. The powerful

- One of the most effective tactics to build better habits is to join a culture where the below 2 points hold **_true_**:

  1. Your desired behaviours are normal behaviour
  1. You already have something in common with the group

- The normal behaviour of a tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of individual. More often, we rather be wrong with crowd than be right by ourselves.

- We find behaviours that can get us approval, praise & respect attractive.

## Chapter 10

- To end bad habit, apply inversion of 2nd law: Make it unattractive. Highlight the benefit of avoiding bad habits to make them unattractive.

- Every behaviour has a surface level craving and deep underlying motive.

- Your habits are modern-days solutions to ancient desires.

- The cause of your habits are actually the prediction that precedes them. And prediction causes feeling. Prediction leads to feeling.

- Habits are attractive when we associate them to positive feeling; unattractive when we associate them to negative one.
  Creates a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before difficult habit.
