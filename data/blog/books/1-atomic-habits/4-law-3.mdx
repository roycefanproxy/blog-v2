## Chapter 11

- The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.

- Practice is an action, whereas planning is motion. Focus of taking action, not being in motion.

- Habit formation is a process by which a behaviour becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.

- The amount of time you have been performing an action is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.

## Chapter 12

- Human behaviour follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate towards the option that requires least amount of work.

- Create an environment where doing a right thing is as easy as possible.

- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviours. When friction is low, habits are easy. Vice Versa.

- Prime your environment to make your future actions easier.

## Chapter 13

- Habits can be complted in a few seconds but continue to impact your behaviour for minutes or hours afterward.

- **Many habits occur at decisive moments**. They are like **forks** in a road - either send you to a productive day, or an unproductive one.

- 2 Minutes Rule states that when you start a new habit, it should take less than 2 minutes to complete.

- The more you ritualise the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus, which is required to do great things.

- **Standardise before you optimise**. You can improve a habit that doesn't exist.

## Chapter 14

- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in a better behaviour in the future.

- The ultimate way to lock in future behaviour is to automate your habits.

- Onetime choices - like enrolling automatic saving plan or buying a better mattress are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.

- Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable & effective way to guarantee the right behaviour.
