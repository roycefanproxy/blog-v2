## Chapter 15

- We are more likely to repeat a behaviour if the experience is satisfying.

- The human brain evolved to prioritise immediate rewards over delayed rewards.

- The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change: what is immediately rewarded is repeated; what is immediately punished is avoided.

- To get a habit to stick you, you need to feel immediately successful, even if it's a **small** way.

- The first 3 laws of behaviour change increase the odds that a behaviour will be performed this time.
  **The 4th law increases the odds that a behaviour will be repeated next time**.

## Chapter 16

- Feeling of making progress is one of the most satisfying feelings.

- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.

- Habit trackers and other visual form of measurement can make your habits satisyfing by providing clear evidence of your progress.

- Do not break the chain. Try to keep your habits streak alive.

- **Never miss twice**. Try to get back on track asap if you miss one day.

- **Measurable task != important task**.

## Chapter 17

- We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it's painful or unsatisfying.

- A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behaviour. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.

- Knowing someone else is watching is a powerful motivator.
