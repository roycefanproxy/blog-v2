## Chapter 4

- Brain is a prediction machine. Given enough practice, your brain will pick up the cue and automatically predict certain outcome without consciously thinking about it.

- Once a habit is cultivated, we will stop paying attention to it. Thus, incident happens.

- Before you can change a habit, you need to be aware of it. Behavioural change always starts with awareness.

- Pointing & Calling raises the level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalising your actions.

- Habits Scorecard can help you to be more aware of your behaviour.

## Chapter 5

- 1<sub>st</sub> law of behavioural change is to make it obvious.

- 2 most common cues are **time** & **location**.

- Implementation intention is a stratety to pair a new habit with specific time & location. The format is "I will \[**Action**\] at \[**Time**\] in \[**Location**\]".

- Habit stacking is a strategy to pair a new habit with a current habit. The format is "After I \[**Current Habit**\], I will \[**New Habit**\]".

## Chapter 6

- Every habit is initiated by a cue. A cue that stands out is more likely to be noticed.

- Gradually, your habit will become associated not only a single trigger, but the entire context around the behaviour. The context becomes the cue.

- Building new habits in new environment is easier as you are not fighting against old cues.

## Chapter 7

- Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.

- **High self-control people tend to spend less time in tempting situation.** It's easier to avoid temptation than resist it.

- The most practical way to eliminate bad habits is to **reduce exposure** to the cue that causes it.

- Self-control is a short term strategy.
