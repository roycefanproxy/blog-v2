## Brief Intro

I was exposed to this book from a sharing of Youtuber on how he managed to transform his life and became the person today (though I forgot which one).
One of the book he mentioned in the video was, you guess it, **Atomic Habits** by **James Clear**.

I'll talk more about the background of this book once I finish the book & turn this post into a proper book review.

## Chapter 1

- Habits are double-edged sword, good one may work for you and bad one will work against you.

- Small change often appear to make no difference until it cross critical threshold. **Be patient**.
  Think of the impact of small change grows exponentially as the time goes on.

- To get better result, goal is not the most important thing, **focus on setting the system of achieving better result**,
  system of atomic habits, composed by tiny habits that can make big difference when they are combined.

## Chapter 2

- **Habits shape your identity, and _vise versa_.**

- There are 3 level of change:

  - _Outcome change_
  - _Process change_
  - _Identity change_

- Most effective way to change your habits is to focus on who you want to be instead of what you want to achieve.

- **Identity are emerged out of habits. Every action is a vote for the identity you wish to become.**

- Habits matter because they can change your beliefs about yourself, not because of they can get you better result.

## Chapter 3

- Habit is a behaviour that has been repeated enough of times to become automatic.

- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve problems of life with minimal effort & energy.

- Habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves 4 steps:

  - _Cue_
  - _Craving_
  - _Response_
  - _Reward_

- **4 laws of behaviour changes are a set of simple rules to build better habits:**

  - _Make it obvious_
  - _Make it attractive_
  - _Make it easy_
  - _Make it satisfying_

- **Conversely, 4 laws of behaviour changes to break bad habits are as below:**
  - _Make it invisible_
  - _Make it unattractive_
  - _Make it difficult_
  - _Make it unsatisfying_
